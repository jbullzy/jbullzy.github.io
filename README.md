This was a project conducting an analysis in Rstudio on data from a bikeshare company, 'Cyclistic'. Part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone project.
Also, my first real piece of code committed to GitHub!

I initially downloaded the data from the bucket provided by google: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

For this analysis, there was one guiding question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? The end result should show a direct comparison between the two. The stakeholders for this project would be the marketing team at Cyclistic as well as the owners.

This data was licensed by Motivate for public use. It's available for download and is verified to be real-world data from Motivate's Divvy bikeshare service.

For this analysis, I used R due to the size of the dataset. This also allowed for the combination and manipulation of each file.

This analysis is on the past 12 months of data from Cyclistic's bikesharing service. For this analysis, we focused on the key differences between member and non-member clients.

The graphs demonstrate the differences between the two types of customers. In the first, we compare the average duration of the ride between members and non-members. In the second, we compare the number of rides between the two groups.

We concluded that members take more rides, on average than non-members and that non-members take longer rides than members.
