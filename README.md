This was a project conducting an analysis in Rstudio on data from a bikeshare company, 'Cyclistic'. Part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone project.
Also, my first real piece of code committed to GitHub!

I initially downloaded the data from the bucket provided by google: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
